        <b>Grading Policies:</b> No late assignments will be accepted. It is vastly preferable to
            <br>submit a partially complete assignment on time than to turn in a late assignment.
            <br><br>
            Similarly, it is vastly more beneficially to turn in a programming or lab assignment that
            <br>has 70% of the features fully implemented than to turn in an assignment that has 100% 
            <br>of the features partially implemented.

        <b>Practices and Policies during the Coronavirus Pandemic</b>
            <br><br>
        <b>Responsiveness to Change</b>
            <br><br>
            Understanding that the COVID-19 pandemic could influence the course of this
            <br>semester, Lewis University will be guided by our Lasallian mission and the well-
            <br>being of our community of students, faculty, and staff in respond and adapting to
            <br>any sudden changes or circumstances. Based on the guidance of the State of
            <br>Illinois and the Centers for Disease Control, it may be necessary to change the
            <br>planned modality this course.
            <br><br>
        <b>Flexibility, Accommodations, and Student Absences</b>
            <br><br>
            Because we are committed to student success, the University community is
            <br>committed to academic standards while maintaining flexibility and empathy.
            <br>Absences relating to the Coronavirus crisis will be recognized as excused.
            <br>Students experiencing disruptions in their lives related to the Coronavirus that
            <br>impact class attendance and participation should contact their instructor and/or
            <br>college Dean’s Office for assistance. Students directly impacted by Coronavirus
            <br>will have the ability to request alternative grading this semester. Requests will be
            <br>evaluated on a case by case basis and will require documentation.
            <br><br>
            Students who require academic accommodations due to disability caused by
            <br>COVID-19, or to limit risk of exposure to Coronavirus, can engage in an
            <br>interactive process with the Learning Access Coordinator to explore all avenues
            <br>for accommodations. Students can contact the Academic Services office at 815-
            <br>836-5593 or learningaccess@lewisu.edu to request an appointment.
            <br><br>
        <b>Face Coverings, Physical Distancing, and Surface Cleaning</b>
            <br><br>
            Face coverings are required in classrooms. Students will be expected to maintain
            <br>physical distancing in the classroom (6 ft minimum) and to keep their nose and
            <br>mouth covered at all times. Faculty will require students without face covering to
            <br>obtain a disposable mask at the nearest University office providing them. While
            <br>the University will disinfect classrooms and common spaces throughout the day,
            <br>cleaning supplies will be provided in classrooms and offices so that students and
            <br>faculty can wipe down work surfaces before class begins

        <b>Information for Students</b>
            <br><br>
        <b>Requests for Reasonable Accommodations</b>
            <br>
            Lewis University is committed to providing equal access and opportunity for participation
            <br>in all programs, services and activities. If you are a student with a disability who would
            <br>like to request a reasonable accommodation, please speak with the Learning Access
            <br>Coordinator at the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE). Please make
            <br>an appointment by calling 815-836-5593 or emailing learningaccess@lewisu.edu. Since
            <br>accommodations require early planning and are not provided retroactively, it is
            <br>recommended that you make your request prior to or during the first week of class. It is
            <br>not necessary to disclose the nature of your disability to your instructor. For more
            <br>information about academic support services, visit the website at:
            <br><a href="www.lewisu.edu/CASE" target="_blank">www.lewisu.edu/CASE</a>
            <br><br>
            Lewis University has adopted Blackboard Ally providing alternative formats for files
            <br>uploaded by instructors. Students can click the down arrow next to any file and select
            <br>Alternative Formats.
            <br><br>
        <b>Sanctified Zone</b>
            <br>
            Guided by its Catholic and Lasallian heritage, Lewis University is firmly committed to
            <br>fostering a campus atmosphere that is permeated by its Mission values of Fidelity,
            <br>Wisdom, Knowledge, Justice, and Association. Accordingly, we have declared the
            <br>University campus to be a Sanctified Zone, a place and a people United in Diversity.
            <br>The active promotion of diversity and the opposition to all forms of prejudice and bias are
            <br>a powerful and healing expression of our desire to be Signs of Faith (Signum Fidei) to
            <br>each other. To learn more about the Sanctified Zone, please visit:
            <br>http://www.lewisu.edu/sanctified zone
            <br><br>
        <b>Academic Integrity</b>
            <br><br>
            Scholastic integrity lies at the heart of Lewis University. Plagiarism, collusion and other
            <br>forms of cheating or scholastic dishonesty are incompatible with the principles of the
            <br>University. Students engaging in such activities are subject to loss of credit and
            <br>expulsion from the University. Cases involving academic dishonesty are initially
            <br>considered and determined at the instructor level. If the student is not satisfied with the
            <br>instructor’s explanation, the student may appeal at the department/program level.
            <br>Appeal of the department /program decision must be made to the Dean of the
            <br>college/school. The Dean reviews the appeal and makes the final decision in all cases
            <br>except those in which suspension or expulsion is recommended, and in these cases the
            <br>Provost makes the final decision.
